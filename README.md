# GitHubAnalyzer
App for comparing repositories stats

# Installation

To run app I recommend to use Docker. Basic cofiguration is in `docker-compose.yml` file.

After it get into container and run `composer install`.

In `.env.local` or `.env.local.php` please set up your GitHub api token in `GITHUB_SECRET`.

Interactive documentation is available at `http://localhost:yourPort/api/doc`.

If you have any problems please contact me
